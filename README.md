# vm-utils

Scripts to manage QEMU-based VMs.

## Why?

I didn't like libvirt.

## Installation

Copy the `vm` folder to your `/etc`, or elsewhere and adjust the `rootdir=` statements in the `scripts/` files.
Optionally, make symlinks for `vm-<script>` to `/etc/vm/scripts/<script>` in your `/usr/local/bin`.
You're gonna want to have `tmux` and `qemu-system-x86_64` installed, as well as KVM (`CONFIG_KVM`) and macvtap (`CONFIG_MACVLAN`) support in your kernel.

## Setup

These scripts presume a setup like Hetzner, where IPv4s and IPv6 ranges are directly routed to your machine and a macvtap interface can accept them.

## Overview

* `machines.d`: Main VM configurations for QEMU;
* `conf`: VM configurations for `vm-utils`;
* `include`: Include files for VM configurations;
* `scripts`: Various scripts to automate VM management:
  - `start`: Start a VM named by `machines.d/<name>.conf`;
  - `stop`: Stop a VM named by `machines.d/<name>conf`;
  - `attach`: Attach to management console of VM named by `machines.d/<name.conf>`;
  - `launch`: Launch VM in current terminal session and attach to management console; used by `start`
  - `ifup`/`ifdown`: Network interface management scripts;

## Adding a new VM

1. Add an entry in `machines.d`, see `example.conf` for format;
2. Add an entry in `conf`, see `example.conf` for format;
3. Create a new disk: `qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/vm/disks/<name>qcow2 <size>G`;
4. Start the VM: `scripts/start <name>`.
